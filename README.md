Adding FXML Files and View Management

1. Add a New FXML File

   Place your FXML file in the correct resource folder:
   src/main/resources/easv/dk/belsign/views/
2. Update FXMLPath.java by adding a new static path:
   public static final String USER_DASHBOARD = "/easv/dk/belsign/views/UserDashboardView.fxml";
